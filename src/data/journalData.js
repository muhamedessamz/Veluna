            <p>For centuries, humanity has looked to the moon as a guide for agriculture, navigation, and timekeeping. But recent dermatological studies suggest that our skin also follows a rhythm that mirrors the lunar cycle.</p>
            
            <h3>The New Moon: Reset and Recovery</h3>
            <p>During the new moon, when the sky is darkest, our skin's permeability is at its lowest. This is the ideal time for deep detoxification and intensive recovery rituals. Focus on rich barrier creams and soothing botanical extracts like chamomile and calendula.</p>
            
            <h3>The Waxing Moon: Absorption and Growth</h3>
            <p>As the moon grows, so does the skin's capacity to absorb nutrients. During this phase, introduce high-potency serums and vitamins. Our Blue Tansy oil is particularly effective during this period, as the skin is most receptive to its antioxidant properties.</p>
            
            <h3>The Full Moon: Peak Sensitivity</h3>
            <p>At the full moon, fluid retention and sensitivity reach their peak. We recommend cooling treatments and gentle lymphatic drainage exercises. Avoid harsh exfoliants and focus on hydration through pure botanical mists.</p>
            
            <h3>The Waning Moon: Elimination and Clarity</h3>
            <p>As the light fades, the skin's natural detoxification processes accelerate. This is the optimal time for exfoliation and clearing treatments to prepare for the next cycle.</p>

            <p>Deep within the Mediterranean landscape grows a small yellow flower with a surprising secret. When steam-distilled, <i>Tanacetum annuum</i>—commonly known as Blue Tansy—transforms into a vivid sapphire oil. This transformation is due to chamazulene, a powerful anti-inflammatory compound produced during the heating process.</p>
            
            <h3>Why Your Skin Craves It</h3>
            <p>Blue Tansy is a master healer for sensitive, damaged, or reactive skin. Its primary benefits include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Anti-Inflammatory:</strong> It rapidly calms redness and irritation.</li>
                <li><strong>Antihistamine:</strong> It helps soothe allergic reactions and heat-induced sensitivity.</li>
                <li><strong>Emotional Balance:</strong> Its sweet, herbaceous scent is clinically proven to reduce stress and anxiety.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h3>How to Use Our Blue Tansy Extract</h3>
            <p>For best results, warm 2-3 drops between your palms and press gently into damp skin as the final step of your evening ritual. Its calming properties sync perfectly with the body's nighttime repair mode.</p>

            <p>Sleep is the ultimate luxury for your skin. While you rest, your skin enters a state of high-intensity repair, producing collagen and fixing damage from UV exposure and pollution. A dedicated nighttime ritual signal to your body that it's time to shift from protection to restoration.</p>
            
            <h3>The Veluna Evening Protocol</h3>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Cleanse:</strong> Remove the day's environmental stressors with a gentle cream-to-oil cleanser.</li>
                <li><strong>Tone:</strong> Use a botanical mist to rebalance pH and provide a layer of hydration.</li>
                <li><strong>Treat:</strong> Apply your active serums while the skin is still damp.</li>
                <li><strong>Seal:</strong> Use a rich night cream or facial oil to lock in moisture and prevent transepidermal water loss.</li>
            </ol>
            
            <h3>Environment Matters</h3>
            <p>To maximize the "beauty sleep" effect, ensure your bedroom is a sanctuary. Keep the temperature cool, eliminate blue light an hour before bed, and consider using a silk pillowcase to prevent friction on delicate facial skin.</p>
